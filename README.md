# NewFolderTypemill-plugins

This is a repository for Typemill plugins that have been modifed to work better with the NewFolderTypemill theme for, you guessed it, Typemill.

None of this is guaranteed to work forever. Everything here was originally created by other, smarter people, and you can find their information in the individual plugin folders.

To install one of these plugins, upload the desired subfolder to the `/plugins` folder in your Typemill installation.
