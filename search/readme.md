# Note:

Below is the original introductory text to the lunr.js search plugin created for Typemill, because I (clearly) didn't make it. This version has been modified to work better with the NewFolder for Typemill theme, and probably shouldn't be used outside of that context.

Unless you don't mind that there's no default CSS. That *would* make it easier to customize in general. Also, I edited some of the search form's HTML to be a little more accessible. Otherwise, this is a total hatchet job, please don't judge me.

## Search Plugin

This plugin integrates a full-text search for your website. It is based on lunr.js. The development of the first version has been sponsored by [vodaris](https://www.vodaris.de/).

Just activate the plugin and it will add a search field to your website (depending on your theme). The plugin does not require any third-party-software like Google Search or Algolia. Instead it includes the JavaScript search library [lunr.js](https://lunrjs.com/) and generate a full-text search index on the fly.
